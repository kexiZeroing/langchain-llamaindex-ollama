# LangChain and Llamaindex - Learn by doing

The LangChain libraries themselves are made up of several different packages:
- `@langchain/core`: Base abstractions and LangChain Expression Language.
- `@langchain/community`: Third party integrations.
- `langchain`: Chains, agents, and retrieval strategies that make up an application's cognitive architecture.

LlamaIndex.TS offers the core features of LlamaIndex for popular runtimes like Node.js (18, 20, 22), Deno, Bun, and Cloudflare Workers.
