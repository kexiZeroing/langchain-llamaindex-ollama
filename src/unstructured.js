// There are three Partioning Strategies for document transformation, fast, hires, or ocr_only.
// `fast` is great for when there is extractable text available, like in HTML files or in the Microsoft Office Document format.
// - `hires` is best for PDFs and tables and where accurate classification of document elements is critical.
// - `ocr_only` is useful when dealing with image-based files or PDFs that do not have extractable text.
// If you’re unsure, select `auto` and we’ll handle the decision for you.
